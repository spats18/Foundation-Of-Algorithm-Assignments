# Understanding-and-Application-of-Algorithmic-Concepts

## Algorithm Analysis Project
This project aims to assess comprehension of designing and analyzing algorithms and their complexities. It consists of five programming assignments and conceptual questions related to algorithmic concepts.

## Assignments
Each assignment builds on the previous one, laying the foundation for advanced algorithms. Here's a brief overview of what each assignment covers:

### Algorithm Design and Analysis: 
Designing and analyzing algorithms, recurrence relations, asymptotic notations, and implementing a sorting algorithm.
### Stable Matching
Matching medical students to hospitals based on preferences, proving stability of the matching, and implementing the algorithm in a programming language.
### Greedy Algorithms and Graphs
Minimum spanning tree and shortest path, minimum-bottleneck spanning tree, and implementing Dijkstra's algorithm with random weights.
### Divide and Conquer
Multiplying two large decimal integers and the closest pair of points algorithm.
### Dynamic Programming
The ski rental problem, a variation of the knapsack problem.

## Requirements
Each assignment requires demonstrating proficiency in algorithm analysis and design, proving algorithm correctness, implementing algorithms in a programming language (C++, Java, or Python), and analyzing their time complexity.

## Conclusion
These assignments provided me with a deep understanding of algorithmic design and analysis, including the ability to determine time and space complexities and prove algorithm stability and correctness. I also gained experience implementing algorithms in Java, which will benefit me in both algorithmic research and software development. Overall, completing these assignments has helped me develop a strong foundation in algorithmic concepts and improve my writing, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills.
